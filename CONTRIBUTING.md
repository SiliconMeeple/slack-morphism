# Contributor guide

## About this document

This guide is for people who would like to be involved in building this library.

## How can I help?
Slack Morphism follows a standard [fork and pull](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) 
model for contributions via GitHub pull requests.

## Let us know you are working on it
If there is already a GitHub issue for the task you are working on,
leave a comment to let people know that you are working on it. If
there isn't already an issue, and it is a non-trivial task, it's a good
idea to create one (and note that you're working on it). This prevents
contributors from duplicating effort.

## Attributions

If your contribution has been derived from or inspired by other work, please
state this in its ScalaDoc comment and provide proper attribution. When
possible, include the original authors' names and a link to the original work.

## Write tests
You're expecting contributing tests covering everything you contribute as well. 
If you need help with it, don't hesitate to ask.
